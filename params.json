{"name":"Kpan Photography","tagline":"Nature photos that you'll love","body":"### Welcome to Kpan Photography.\r\nKuan-Tung Pan has been working in artistic creation in photography for more than 30 years and had held personal exhibition in both Taiwan and US.\r\nMesmerized and intoxicated with Tang and Song Dynasty Chinese poetries since I was young, I have been longing to materialize these poetries from imagination into visual impact and that’s how I fell for photography.\r\n\r\n### Bio\r\nAfter I came to the U.S. and got in touch with Western literature such as “As I Lay Dying” by William Faulkner, it truly unveiled humanity and enlightened me, made me understand who I am and deeply impacted my way of artistic creation in photography.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by both Eastern and Western literature, life long experiences and relentless self-feedback, I gradually formed the keynote of my work: By the ways through a viewfinder, symbolizes natural phenomenon to reflect the knowledge, experiences and humanity I have contemplated through this life.\r\n\r\nI have traveled more than 20 countries to search, experience and actualize the artwork I intended to do since my young adulthood. Photography has always been more than just a hobby but a life long commitment to me. It’s beyond merely a way of artistic expression but a practice of living and reward of life.\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
